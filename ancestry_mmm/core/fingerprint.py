"""
Deterministic SHA-256 fingerprints of the three inputs that together define
"the fitted model": the modelling data, the model specification (structure +
priors), and the fitted posterior. Used to bind a ModelApproval to the exact
model run it was granted for (see core.approval.ModelApproval.matches_current_model)
rather than merely to "some model having been trained".

All three functions are pure and depend only on their arguments - never on
wall-clock time, object identity, or dict/set iteration order - so the same
inputs always produce the same fingerprint, and two logically-identical
inputs constructed differently (e.g. a dict built key-by-key in a different
order) still match.

    Fingerprint the full set of inputs that determine how the model is
    *built*: the structural ModelSpec (markets/segments/channels/DNA
    channels/promo & control columns/LTV), the prior overrides, the DNA
    halo lag, which model structure was fit, the transformation recipe that
    produced the modelling data (`pipeline_steps`), the calculation-
    relevant subset of market/channel configuration (`market_spec_config`,
    filtered by `_model_relevant_market_config` - see that function's
    docstring for the descriptive/model-relevant boundary), which
    outcome_ids get a direct DNA-media pathway (`direct_dna_outcome_ids` -
    the DNA-kit outcome_ids actually included in this fit, per
    `core.outcomes`/the Structure page's exclude-from-fit control; see
    `FHModelMeta.kit_only_outcome_ids`/`docs/dna_fh_causal_structure.md`),
    and the full canonical outcome catalogue (`outcome_catalogue` - PR E.1;
    pass `core.outcomes.outcome_catalogue_fingerprint_payload(outcomes)`,
    already sorted by outcome_id with only the calculation-relevant fields:
    outcome_id/product/segment/metric/unit/source_column/role/
    included_in_fit/value_weight/value_currency) - i.e. everything that
    determines the fitted model and what it's used to calculate, besides
    the data values themselves (those are covered separately by
    `fingerprint_dataframe`). A changed prior therefore changes this
    fingerprint, since priors are part of the fitted model's identity - and
    so does switching model structure (`model_type`): a shared-curve fit
    and a market-specific fit of the *same* data/spec/priors are not the
    same fitted model, and an approval granted for one must not be treated
    as valid for the other (docs/decision_log.md, market-specific
    redesign). Likewise, `outcome_catalogue` is what makes adding/removing
    a non-DNA FH outcome, changing sign-up to GSA, changing unit/source
    column/role/inclusion, or changing the value weight used in planning,
    into a fingerprint-breaking change - closing the gap the instruction
    document's audit confirmed: `direct_dna_outcome_ids` alone only covered
    DNA-kit outcome membership, not any of the rest of an outcome's
    identity, so e.g. relabelling a GSA outcome as a sign-up outcome (or
    vice versa) could previously leave an approval "matching" a
    structurally different fit.

    `outcome_groups` (REQ-DATAIN-002 WP1 - pass
    `core.outcomes.outcome_group_fingerprint_payload(groups)`) captures the
    calculation-relevant semantic grouping contract. It is sorted by
    `group_id` and excludes presentation-only group labels, so changing which
    outcomes belong to a group, its aggregation rule, or its supplied total
    invalidates the fit identity while a wording edit does not. The grouping
    contract is distinct from diagnostic reconciliation groups and from causal
    graph/pathway edges.

    `model_type` defaults to `"shared"` (core.hierarchical_model's model,
    "Model A") so existing call sites that don't pass it keep fingerprinting
    that model type explicitly, not omitting model identity from the hash.
    `pipeline_steps`, `market_spec_config`, `direct_dna_outcome_ids`,
    `outcome_catalogue`, `outcome_groups`, and `outcome_group_treatments` default to `None` (treated as
    empty) for the same
    reason - a caller with nothing to pass still gets a deterministic,
    explicit fingerprint rather than an error. `direct_dna_outcome_ids` is
    sorted before hashing - it names an unordered set of outcome_ids, so two
    calls listing the same outcome_ids in a different order must fingerprint
    identically; `outcome_catalogue` is likewise re-sorted by its own
    `outcome_id` key here (defensively - callers are expected to already
    pass it pre-sorted) for the same reason. `outcome_groups` and
    `outcome_group_treatments` are likewise re-sorted by their `group_id`
    keys here defensively. A treatment change such as `components_joint` to
    `total_only` therefore invalidates dependent evidence.

    `funnel_links` (PR E.2 - `core.funnel.FunnelLink`s, pass
    `core.funnel.funnel_links_fingerprint_payload(links)`) is diagnostic
    configuration - it never affects what gets fitted - but is still
    calculation-relevant to the *diagnostics displayed*, so it is
    fingerprinted the same way as the outcome catalogue: sorted by
    (upstream_outcome_id, downstream_outcome_id) here defensively, `[]` when
    omitted.

    `media_outcome_pathways` (PR F - `core.pathways.MediaOutcomePathway`s,
    pass `core.pathways.pathway_catalogue_fingerprint_payload(pathways)`) is,
    like `funnel_links`, configuration that does not (yet) change what gets
    fitted - no model equation reads it - but is calculation-*adjacent*
    metadata a future estimation PR will read, and is captured at fit time
    (`FHModelMeta.pathway_catalogue_at_fit`) for drift detection the same way
    the outcome catalogue is. Sorted by `(channel, target_outcome_id)` here
    defensively, `[]` when omitted.

    `activity_fit_fingerprint` (PR G2A.6c workstream F -
    `core.activities.activity_fit_fingerprint(activity_definitions)`) covers
    only the fit-relevant activity fields (market, activity_id, model_role,
    resolved model-input column, pathway_ids) - never economic_treatment,
    planning_eligibility or governance/approval metadata, which don't change
    what gets fitted. Changing an activity from `intervention` to `mediator`,
    repointing it at a different model-input column, or relinking its
    pathways therefore changes this fingerprint and correctly stales any
    approval bound to the old one, the same way changing `model_type` does.
    `""` when omitted (no activity governance data available).

    `causal_graph_structural_fingerprint` (REQ-GRAPH-001 work package D -
    `core.causal_graph.CausalGraph.structural_fingerprint()`) is the
    structural (never layout) fingerprint of the approved `CausalGraph`
    actually compiled for this fit, when one was used (see
    `core.graph_model_compiler.GraphModelCompiler`). `""` when omitted (no
    graph was used - either the project has no approved causal graph
    configured, or this fingerprint was computed via
    `core.causal_graph.current_structural_fingerprint_for_identity` for a
    fit that didn't use one). A layout-only edit to the graph never changes
    this value, so it never stales a bound approval; a structural edit
    always does, the same as every other field in this payload.

    `search_object_fit_fingerprint` (REQ-SEARCH-001 fit-identity closure -
    `core.search_objects.search_object_fit_fingerprint(search_objects,
    consumed_model_input_columns=model_spec["channels"])`) covers only the
    Search objects this fit actually consumes (a current-version, non-blank
    `model_input_column` matching one of this fit's own channels) and, for
    those, only their fit-relevant content fields (market, search_object_id,
    search_role, source_column, model_input_column, unit, grain, product) -
    never `channel`, `effective_period_start`/`effective_period_end`,
    `state`, `planning_eligibility`, `evidence_status`, approval metadata,
    `currency`, `schema_version`, or `search_object_version` (the
    governance/audit version counter - excluded so that a purely
    administrative sanctioned edit, which still bumps it, never stales a
    fit; see `search_object_fit_fingerprint`'s docstring), and never a
    Search object this fit does not consume, or a superseded version of one
    it does. `""` when omitted (no Search governance data available, or
    none of it is consumed by this fit).

    `variable_coverage_fingerprint` (REQ-COVERAGE-001 S5 - pass
    `core.coverage.VariableCoverageMatrix.fingerprint()`, which already
    hashes only `VariableCoverageRecord.fit_relevant_fields()`, never
    administrative/audit-only fields such as `owner`, `proposed_treatment`,
    approval attribution, observed/expected diagnostic windows, or free-text
    justifications - see that method's docstring for the full boundary) is a
    simple pass-through, like `causal_graph_structural_fingerprint`, not a
    consumption-filtered value like `search_object_fit_fingerprint`: unlike
    Search objects (which map onto specific model-input columns this fit
    either does or doesn't consume), the coverage matrix has no such
    per-fit consumption relationship yet - nothing in the current data
    pipeline reads a variable's coverage/treatment classification to decide
    what value to prepare (that binding is `FR-MOD-015`'s job, explicitly
    unresolved - REQ-COVERAGE-001 S6). Passing the live matrix's fingerprint
    here today therefore does exactly what REQ-COVERAGE-001 S5 requires, no
    more and no less: "a coverage or treatment change that alters
    prepared-data semantics must change prepared-data/model identity ... a
    purely presentational metadata change must not" - `fit_relevant_fields()`
    already strips the presentational fields, so every remaining change this
    fingerprint reacts to is calculation-relevant by construction, and once
    a future package makes coverage/treatment decisions actually change what
    gets fitted, this same wiring already staled every approval bound to the
    old, unaware fingerprint. `""` when omitted (no coverage matrix governed
    yet for this project).

    `named_event_classification_fingerprint` (event-upload-contract
    implementation brief follow-up audit) is a SEPARATE governance
    component from `named_event_fit_fingerprint` above, not a replacement
    for it: `named_event_fit_fingerprint` is `NamedEventFitInputs.
    fingerprint()`'s numerical design/consumed-response-definition
    identity, which deliberately EXCLUDES a family's governed
    `classification` (e.g. "gifting" vs "promotional") - a design choice
    recorded in `core.named_event_fit_inputs.NamedEventFamilyFitBlock`'s
    own docstring, because a pure reclassification with no window/
    occurrence change produces byte-identical `design` arrays and is a
    distinct kind of change from a design-affecting one. `REQ-EVENT-001`
    section 8 nonetheless requires "changing... family mapping [or
    classification]... must stale the affected fit" - reusing the exact
    per-family fingerprint `core.named_events.fingerprint_event_family`
    already computes (never a new hashing scheme), restricted to the
    families this fit actually consumed (pass `core.named_event_fit_
    inputs.NamedEventFitInputs.consumed_family_classifications()` via
    `core.named_event_fit_inputs.named_event_classification_fingerprint`)
    closes that gap without folding classification into the numerical
    design fingerprint. Opt-in exactly like `named_event_fit_fingerprint`
    - `""`/omitted for a fit that consumed no named event, so this
    addition never invalidates an approval that has nothing to do with
    named events.

    `named_event_occurrence_governance_fingerprint` (occurrence-staleness
    follow-up) is a THIRD, separate named-event governance component,
    alongside `named_event_fit_fingerprint` (numerical design/consumed-
    response-definition identity) and `named_event_classification_
    fingerprint` (per-family classification identity): pass `core.
    named_event_fit_inputs.named_event_occurrence_governance_fingerprint`
    (or read it off `core.named_event_fit_inputs.NamedEventIdentityResult.
    occurrence_governance_fingerprint` via `safe_named_event_identity`).
    It hashes the governed fields of every occurrence actually consumed at
    fit time (event_id/version, family_id, factual dates, market_scope,
    source_id/version) - fields the numerical design fingerprint cannot
    see because it hashes the resulting weekly design, not the occurrence
    record that produced it, so a within-week date correction, a version/
    lineage-only edit, or a market-scope edit that happens not to change
    activated weeks would otherwise leave every existing named-event
    fingerprint unchanged. Same opt-in contract - `""`/omitted for a fit
    that consumed no named event.

    Note: adding `pipeline_steps`, `market_spec_config`,
    `direct_dna_outcome_ids`, `outcome_catalogue`, `outcome_groups`,
    `outcome_group_treatments`,
    `funnel_links`,
    `media_outcome_pathways`, `activity_fit_fingerprint`,
    `causal_graph_structural_fingerprint`, `search_object_fit_fingerprint`
    and `variable_coverage_fingerprint` to this payload is an intentional
    breaking change to every fingerprint this function produces, including
    for callers who pass none of them (the payload always carries
    `"pipeline_steps": []`, `"market_relevant_config": {}`,
    `"direct_dna_outcome_ids": []`, `"outcome_catalogue": []`,
    `"outcome_groups": []`, `"outcome_group_treatments": []`,
    `"funnel_links": []`, `"media_outcome_pathways": []`,
    `"activity_fit_fingerprint": ""`,
    `"causal_graph_structural_fingerprint": ""`,
    `"search_object_fit_fingerprint": ""` and
    `"variable_coverage_fingerprint": ""` keys now) - the same pattern used
    when `model_type` was added (docs/decision_log.md). Every pre-existing
    approval is invalidated by upgrading to this version, which is correct:
    an approval bound to a fingerprint that didn't cover the transformation
    recipe, media-unit/currency config, DNA-kit outcome membership, the full
    outcome catalogue, fit-relevant activity governance, the compiled causal
    graph, fit-relevant Search governance, or the governed coverage matrix
    was never actually binding on them, so forcing re-review is the honest
    behaviour, not a regression.

    `population_fit_fingerprint` (REQ-POPULATION-001, Part 4 v1.8 `AD-019` -
    pass `core.population_preparation.population_dependency_fingerprint`)
    is opt-in exactly like `named_event_fit_fingerprint`/`calibration_fit_
    fingerprint` above: omitted from the payload entirely (not even an
    empty-string placeholder) whenever population treatment is inactive,
    which is every existing UK-only fit. A population reference or
    treatment-specification change can therefore never stale a fit that
    doesn't consume it. It becomes fit-relevant only once an approved
    model specification actually activates population treatment - which
    no current production path can do (see `core.population_preparation.
    PopulationTreatmentUnresolvedError`).

    Canonical JSON with sorted dict keys, so insertion order never matters;
    list order is preserved (json.dumps does not reorder lists), since list
    order is meaningful (e.g. `channels`, `pipeline_steps`) - except
    `direct_dna_outcome_ids`/`outcome_catalogue`/`outcome_groups`, sorted
    explicitly above for exactly that reason.
