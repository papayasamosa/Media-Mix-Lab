without this app (pandas.read_parquet, json, arviz.from_netcdf).

reconstruct_model_state() and verify_imported_approval() below turn a raw
import_project() result into re-derived model artefacts (frame, posterior
params) and a verified-or-rejected approval, without requiring a full
re-fit - see their docstrings.

def reconstruct_model_state(imported: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Given the dict returned by import_project(), re-derive the model
    artefacts that aren't directly serialised in the bundle - the modelling
    frame and posterior parameters - from what is: official_prepared_data (when
    present) or transformed_data +
    model_spec + outcome_definitions (frame; no MCMC involved, just the
    same pandas/numpy prep fit uses) and trace + model_meta (posterior
    params; posterior summarisation, not re-sampling). Doesn't require or
    trigger a re-fit.

    The frame is rebuilt from the *same* outcome catalogue the original fit
    used - `resolve_outcome_definitions(imported.get("outcome_definitions"),
    ...)`, the identical derivation `pages/04_Model_Config.py` uses when
    first preparing a frame - filtered to outcomes whose `source_column` is
    actually present in `transformed_data` (the same defensive filtering
    the old DNA-kit-only version of this function did, now applied to the
    whole catalogue since any outcome, not just a DNA one, could in
    principle reference a column that's since vanished). `included_in_fit`
    (persisted on each `OutcomeDefinition` - PR E) is respected exactly as
    any other fit would respect it, via `prepare_fh_modeling_frame`'s own
    `included_outcomes()` filtering - unlike the pre-PR-E `excluded_outcome_ids`
    mechanism this replaces, a reimport now reconstructs the *exact* set of
    outcomes that were included at fit time, not "every mapped DNA outcome
    regardless of exclusions in effect when the project was saved".

    Returns {"frame": ..., "model_meta": ..., "posterior_params": ...},

    Decide whether an imported project's approval is still valid against its
    (reconstructed) model artefacts. Never silently accepts or discards a
    mismatch: always returns an explanatory message alongside the verdict,
    for the caller to show the user. Returns (None, reason) when the
    approval should NOT be treated as valid; (approval, reason) when it is
    verified.

    `imported` is an import_project() result; `reconstructed` is a
    reconstruct_model_state(imported) result.

    PR 88A: `current_policy`/`approval_readiness` should be the caller's
    already-verified policy and readiness for this same bundle (e.g. from
    `application.project_service.verify_imported_readiness`) - passed
    through to `require_matching_approval` so a *policy-backed* approval is
    checked against the full chain (policy active, readiness overall_ready,
    every fingerprint binding matches), not model identity alone. Previously
    this function only checked `matches_current_model()`, so a policy-backed
    approval whose readiness had just been rejected as unverified could
    still come back "verified" here on identity alone. Both parameters
    default to `None`, which preserves the original identity-only behaviour
    for legacy/unbound approvals (`require_matching_approval` only consults
    them when the approval itself references a `validation_policy_id`).
