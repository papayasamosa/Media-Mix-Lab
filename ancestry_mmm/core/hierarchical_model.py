"""
Joint hierarchical Family-History (FH) MMM.

One Negative-Binomial outcome model per market, covering all FH segments
(New, DNA cross-sell, Winback, ...) jointly rather than as separate
unrelated fits. Channel-level adstock and saturation curves are *shared*
across segments and markets; segment-specific response strength, promo
sensitivity and the DNA halo pathway are estimated through partial
pooling, so segments borrow strength where data is thin and diverge where
the data supports it. See ancestry_mmm/core/schema.py for the ModelSpec
that defines markets/segments/channels/DNA channels/promo columns feeding
this builder, and data/preprocessor.prepare_fh_modeling_frame for how a
joined DataFrame becomes the arrays this function consumes.

Deliberately staged: geometric adstock + Hill saturation only for this
build (Stage 1 per the requirements brief - "ship a robust core before
harder-to-justify refinements"). Media x context interaction terms are out
of scope here.

@dataclass
class FHModelMeta:
    """
    Structural metadata about a built model that isn't fully recoverable from
    the InferenceData's coords alone (e.g. which channels are DNA channels,
    the halo lag). core/predict.py uses this to replay the model's math in
    plain NumPy for scenario planning and out-of-sample diagnostics.

    `outcome_ids` is this model's primary identity dimension (PR E, "make
    OutcomeDefinition the canonical modelling schema" - docs/decision_log.md)
    - NOT segment. Two distinct KPIs (e.g. a Family History sign-up and a
    Family History GSA) can share a `segment` while being two independent
    `outcome_id`s in `outcome_ids`, each with its own fitted response curve.
    `outcome_id_to_segment`/`_product`/`_metric`/`_metric_key`/`_unit`/`_role`/
    `_eligibility`/`_source_column` carry the rest of each fitted outcome_id's
    catalogue entry (see core.outcomes.OutcomeDefinition) for anything that
    needs to group or label by those dimensions without re-deriving them.
    `_metric_key` is the stable key `core.outcomes.select_outcome_ids`
    matches on (PR E.2); `_eligibility` is each outcome_id's resolved
    `core.outcomes.outcome_eligibility()` result at fit time.
    `outcome_catalogue_at_fit` is the exact `OutcomeDefinition` list this fit
    was built from - the source of truth for detecting drift between what a
    model was fit on and what the catalogue currently says (core.outcomes.
    outcome_status's "Stale" detection).

    `pathway_catalogue_at_fit` (PR F) is the exact `MediaOutcomePathway` list
    (`core.pathways`) captured when this fit was built, if a pathway
    catalogue was configured - pure pass-through metadata for
    `core.pathways.pathway_drift_status`'s drift detection, exactly like
    `outcome_catalogue_at_fit` but for the pathway catalogue.

    `pathway_masks` (PR G1) is the *operational* resolution of that
    catalogue - `core.pathways.resolve_pathway_masks`'s output, computed
    once at build time and reused both by this builder (to construct the
    right priors/masks) and by `core.predict`/`core.market_specific_predict`/
    `core.attribution`/`core.market_specific_attribution` (to replay the
    identical structure in NumPy) - the single source of truth for which
    `(outcome, channel)` cells are `primary_direct`/`active_cross_product`/
    `exploratory_cross_product`/excluded, so a fitted model's curves/
    attribution/scenario numbers can never silently diverge from what was
    actually fit. See docs/media_outcome_pathways.md and this file's
    `build_fh_hierarchical_model` for the full behaviour.

    `dna_outcome_id` is specifically the Family History DNA-cross-sell
    outcome - the halo/cross-product pathway's traditional target.
    `direct_dna_outcome_ids` lists every outcome_id that gets a *direct*
    (`primary_direct`, per `pathway_masks`) pathway from DNA-targeted media -
    `dna_outcome_id` is always a member; DNA-product outcomes (kit sales -
    see core.outcomes) are the other members once they're included in a fit.

    PR G1 (`core.pathways.resolve_pathway_masks`) generalised what were once
    two DNA-specific media inputs into the general `primary_mask`/
    `cross_product_lag_media` machinery every channel now shares - see this
    module's `build_fh_hierarchical_model` and `pathway_masks`'s docstring
    below for the operational detail; `direct_dna_outcome_ids`/
    `kit_only_outcome_ids`/`halo_eligible_outcome_ids` remain as this fit's
    *legacy-default* DNA routing (used only when no pathway catalogue
    overrides a DNA-channel cell), not a separate mechanism from
    `pathway_masks` itself. Two genuinely separate media inputs still feed
    the legacy-default DNA routing (not one shared lagged series gated by a
    multiplier - see docs/dna_fh_causal_structure.md and docs/decision_log.md
    for why the older `halo_strength = 1` encoding of "direct" was replaced):
    the undelayed saturated DNA spend (a purchase-driven response) for
    `direct_dna_outcome_ids`, and that same spend further lagged by
    `dna_lag_weeks` (a delayed, decision-cycle response) for
    `halo_eligible_outcome_ids`. `dna_outcome_id` is the one outcome that
    gets *both* pathways simultaneously by legacy default (`kit_only_outcome_ids`
    excludes it) - a DNA-kit outcome genuinely has no halo/cross-product
    pathway onto itself, but the FH DNA-cross-sell outcome may plausibly
    respond to DNA media both immediately and with a delay, so both terms are
    estimated (the delayed one regularised, shrunk toward zero by default -
    see `active_cross_product_strength_est`'s prior in the model builders)
    and summed.

            *direct* target, not a halo recipient

            named_event_response.NAMED_EVENT_RESPONSE_STRUCTURE`). Each
            `(market, family)` block gets its own independent spline-basis
            coefficient vector (unpooled per market/family by default,
            Decision 12 dimension 4), regularised by one shared per-family
            `HalfNormal` shrinkage scale. None (the default, and every
            project with no named event opted in) reproduces exactly
            today's behaviour - no event term exists in the model graph at
