"""Application boundary for the official-preparation review.

pure orchestration that combines the compiled proposal, governed coverage, and
the explicit project calendar into the two persisted readiness records.  It
keeps that boundary callable from tests and future non-Streamlit entry points
without changing the core preparation contracts.
