# Approved implementation requirements

The `REQ-PREFIT-*` category covers mandatory pre-fit diagnostics and the
production-submission gate.

This directory stores concise, repository-controlled implementation decisions derived from approved human product requirements. Each record captures a *business* requirement approved upstream of implementation, before any code is written against it.

This directory is separate from `docs/decision_log.md`, which records engineering decisions made *during* implementation (design trade-offs, phasing, rejected alternatives).

## Authority

Coding agents must implement from:

1. the current task-specific implementation brief
2. approved requirement records in this directory (see `index.json`)
3. applicable `AGENTS.md` invariants
4. existing schemas, tests, migrations and documented code contracts

Coding agents must not independently interpret or reconcile the external Ancestry MMM PRD.

## How to use

- `index.json` is the machine-readable registry of all current approved requirements
- Each `REQ-*.md` file contains the full decision, scope, affected modules, required tests, and human traceability reference
- A record may approve a *blocking invariant* (e.g. "NBT must not be a default") without yet approving the underlying business value (the final NBT event definition)
- Tests that enforce business-critical invariants must cite one or more requirement IDs in their docstring

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Under review, not yet approved for implementation |
| `approved_for_implementation` | Approved and ready for coding work |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer requirement record |
| `deprecated` | No longer applicable |

## Requirement ID convention

`REQ-{CATEGORY}-{NUMBER}`, e.g.:

- `REQ-AUTH-*` — requirements authority and governance
- `REQ-OUT-*` — outcome definitions and governance
- `REQ-NBT-*` — net bill-through
- `REQ-PLAN-*` — scenario planning and optimisation
- `REQ-USE-*` — official versus exploratory use
- `REQ-STALE-*` — staleness and invalidation
- `REQ-GRAPH-*` — graph-authoritative causal configuration
- `REQ-SEARCH-*` — Search demand/delivery/spend/cap/organic-capture object separation, governed Search-intent taxonomy and term/query mapping, and multi-axis granularity eligibility (contribution/curve/economics/planning/optimisation are independently gated)
- `REQ-SEO-*` — governed SEO visibility/ranking metric-definition and observation data shape, distinct from organic Search capture (causal role, estimand, and any controllable intervention remain separately deferred)
- `REQ-ECON-*` — governed CPA/ROI arithmetic and value-join contract (what the value operand actually represents — FH projected LTR, DNA revenue, week/segment variation, FX-for-value, waterfall accounting — remains separately deferred)
- `REQ-COVERAGE-*` — variable coverage, missingness-state, and mixed-frequency data authority
- `REQ-DATAIN-*` — data input contract: logical source domains and cross-market activity identity
- `REQ-ACTIVITY-*` — governed activity identity, reporting taxonomy, and funnel classification
- `REQ-STATE-*` — sequential (weekly, state-transition) simulation state contract
- `REQ-SCEN-*` — sequential scenario evaluation, monthly-to-weekly phasing, and horizon/terminal reporting
- `REQ-ENGINE-*` — primary production MMM engine selection and capability-classification governance
- `REQ-SCENGINE-*` — bounded structural causal engine adapter, capability resolution, and runtime isolation
- `REQ-SCEFFECT-*` — structural causal posterior intervention effects contract
- `REQ-CAUSALROBUST-*` — causal robustness evidence (DAG falsification, placebo/permutation refutation, unmeasured-confounding sensitivity)
- `REQ-SCCURVE-*` — structural intervention curve provenance and planning-eligibility boundary
- `REQ-EVENT-*` — governed named-event occurrence, family, response-definition, and future-replay contracts
- `REQ-CONTROL-*` — model-control representation and coefficient-prior calibration for a specific candidate (never a universal default)
- `REQ-HIERARCHY-*` — outcome-level partial-pooling hierarchy structure for a specific candidate, including gated diagnostic-only challenger forms (never a production default by implication)
- `REQ-FX-*` — governed FX translation architecture: currency-concept separation, canonical monetary record, immutable rate-set governance, conversion-method vocabulary, provider-adapter pattern, future-assumption/scenario-optimisation translation, and reporting/year-on-year decomposition (Finance-owned operational choices — provider, rate set, rounding — remain separately deferred; Finance constant-dollar annual is the approved default method per `REQ-FX-003`'s 2026-08-30 addendum)
- `REQ-OPT-*` — optimiser objective-kind and constraint-kind vocabulary (multi-objective goals, month x channel constraint types) — objective-kind precondition gating and the extended constraint-kind vocabulary implemented as additive, standalone modules (2026-08-31); no numeric default invented, and `core.optimization`'s own SLSQP call sites remain unmodified pending a future production-integration pass
- `REQ-DATASUPPORT-*` — evidence-based per-channel data-support/identifiability classification, consolidating existing coverage/identifiability diagnostics — consolidation architecture implemented as an additive, standalone module (2026-08-31); no numeric threshold or combination-rule policy approved
- `REQ-PLANACT-*` — structured planned marketing activity and promotion-period future inputs, materialising into the existing `core.planning.future_context.build_future_context` contract — implemented (2026-08-31); no Scenario Planner UI wiring yet
- `REQ-POPULATION-*` — governed country-level population reference and population-treatment specification, separate from the pre-existing informational `MarketDescriptors.population` scalar — governed-reference/treatment-specification objects and ingestion/persistence implemented (2026-09-12); population-treatment always defaults to inactive; wiring an exposure/offset term into `core.hierarchical_model` remains deferred pending the open `DD-020`/`MD-025` reference-period policy decision (see `docs/population_reference_period_policy_decision.md`) and an approved multi-market model specification
